Upload the ZIP File:

Upload the cat-and-dog.zip file to your Google Colab environment. You can do this using the file upload dialog in Colab.
Create Directories:

Create a directory to extract the ZIP file. This directory will hold the extracted contents, including the Cat and Dog folders.
Extract the ZIP File:

Extract the contents of cat-and-dog.zip to the newly created directory. Ensure the extraction is successful and the Cat and Dog folders are created correctly within this directory.
Set the Dataset Path:

Define the path to the directory where the Cat and Dog folders are located. This path will be used to access the images for processing.
Iterate Through Images:

Iterate through the images in the Cat and Dog directories. For each image:
Read the image using OpenCV.
Convert the image to grayscale.
Resize the image to a fixed size (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
Extract HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features from the image.
Handle Errors:

Implement error handling to skip any images that cannot be read or processed correctly. Print informative messages for debugging if necessary.
Prepare Data for Training:

Normalize the extracted features.
Flatten the feature arrays for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train an SVM Model:

Define a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning.
Train an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model using the training set and perform hyperparameter tuning with grid search.
Evaluate the best model on the testing set and print the accuracy and classification report.
